# IMDb User Ratings for the series Frasier

This is a project I created in the Data Visualization Society's mentorship program.

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive, responsive data visualization using Svelte, D3 and a dataset of my choice. Since Frasier is my favorite TV show, it is the dataset I found, cleaned, and used.

[Connor Rothschild's barebones starter template for making data visualizations with Svelte + D3](https://github.com/allanwheeler/svelte-visualization-template) served as the base for this project to work from.
